## Building
### 1. Install the necessary dependencies:
```
npm install
```
This command installs all the dependencies defined in the package.json file and is necessary for running the application locally.

### 2. In the project directory, you can run the following scripts:
```
npm run dev
```
Open http://localhost:5173 to view it in your browser. The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.
